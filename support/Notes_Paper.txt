Notes for paper:

* Be prepared for rejections.

* Trim down the abstract. Push some of the language into the Introduction. The Introduction is weak - it doesn't really introduce the problem.

* Abstract is meant to be a more concise introduction of the problem and solution. Look at some sample abstracts for examples on what to do.

* Either remove the subsection headers, or come up with subsections. Same for abstract. FIE's format doesn't have them.

* Create tables with LaTeX.

* Fix acknowledgments.
